# BoardroomX: Privacy-Preserving Governance on Avalanche

**BoardroomX** is a privacy-centric governance platform built for the [Avalanche Hack2Build: Privacy Edition](https://build.avax.network/hackathons/a0e06824-4d70-4b60-98f7-4cf5d4c28b59) hackathon. It enables secure, confidential decision-making for DAOs and corporate boardrooms on the Avalanche blockchain. Using the [Encrypted ERC-20 (eERC20)](https://github.com/ava-labs/EncryptedERC) standard in **converter mode**, BoardroomX wraps the `GovToken` ERC20 token to provide private balances and transfers, with zk-SNARKs for anonymous operations. The platform ensures sensitive governance actions (e.g., voting, budget allocations) remain confidential while maintaining on-chain auditability, ideal for organizations prioritizing privacy and compliance.

## üèÜ Hack2Build Privacy Edition - Round 2 Submission

This repository represents the **progress update for Round 2** of the Avalanche Hack2Build Privacy Edition (Deadline: **September 7, 2025**). We have advanced our roadmap by building a functional private governance system with real on-chain interactions and a polished frontend.

---

## üîç Key Features

- **üîê Private Token Operations**: `GovToken` (ERC20) is deposited into `EncryptedERC` (converter mode) for encrypted balances, supporting private minting, transfers, and burns via homomorphic encryption (ElGamal) and zk-SNARKs.
- **üèõÔ∏è Restricted Boardroom Model**: Only designated board members can participate, with a chairman controlling membership (add/remove, transfer chairmanship).
- **üîç Auditor Compliance**: Auditors (e.g., `0x59c2C8Aa563d835F698543D6226c9c01ACf3a866`) register with zk-SNARK proofs to monitor encrypted transactions without compromising privacy.
- **üß© ZK Proof Generation**: Client-side proof generation for user registration (`runRegisterProof.ts`), with plans for voting/transfer proofs.
- **‚ö° Avalanche Fuji Deployment**: Deployed on Fuji testnet, leveraging C-Chain's high-throughput for scalable, private transactions.
- **üó≥Ô∏è Private Governance**: Built `GovernorZK` contract for private voting and budget proposals using encrypted balances.
- **üì± Interactive dApp**: Built a React-based frontend that connects to MetaMask, displays on-chain proposals, and simulates private voting.
- **üí∏ Real Private Deposit**: Successfully executed a **real deposit** of `0.3 BGT` into `EncryptedERC` on Fuji testnet.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity with Foundry for testing/deployment. Inherits from:
  - OpenZeppelin's Governance contracts (for `GovernorZK`).
  - Ava Labs' EncryptedERC for eERC20 in converter mode.
- **Privacy Mechanisms**:
  - ElGamal encryption for confidential balances/transfers.
  - zk-SNARKs (Circom circuits) for proof verification (registration, mint, transfer, burn).
- **Frontend**: React + Framer Motion + ethers.js
- **Testing**: 20+ passing tests in `GovernorZK.t.sol`, `BoardManagement.t.sol`, and `GovTokenPrivacyTest.sol`.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `lib/encrypted-erc`: EncryptedERC for eERC20 functionality.
  - `lib/openzeppelin-contracts`: Governance/ERC20 utilities.
  - `lib/forge-std`: Foundry testing framework.
  - `lib/encrypted-erc/src`: TypeScript SDK for proof generation (`runRegisterProof.ts`, `registerProof.ts`).

## üöÄ Progress on Roadmap (Hackathon Round 2)

The MVP demonstrated in Round 1 has been extended with real governance functionality:

- ‚úÖ **Private Deposits**: Users deposit `GovToken` into `EncryptedERC` (converter mode) for encrypted balances, tested and now **executed on-chain**.
- ‚úÖ **Auditor Registration**: Real zk-SNARK proof generated (`runRegisterProof.ts`) for auditor (`0x59c2C8Aa563d835F698543D6226c9c01ACf3a866`).
- ‚úÖ **Board Management**: Functional boardroom model (add/remove members, chairmanship) via `BoardManagement.t.sol`.
- ‚úÖ **Fuji Deployment**: Contracts deployed and tested on-chain.
- ‚úÖ **GovernorZK**: Deployed and verified `GovernorZK` contract for private voting and proposals.
- ‚úÖ **On-Chain Proposal**: Created a real proposal via `propose()` in `GovernorZK`.
- ‚úÖ **Frontend dApp**: Built a responsive dApp that connects wallet, shows proposals, and simulates private voting.
- ‚úÖ **Real Private Deposit**: Executed a real `deposit()` transaction to `EncryptedERC` with approved BGT tokens.

## üß™ Testing

Run `forge test` to execute:

- **20+ passing tests** in `GovernorZK.t.sol`, `BoardManagement.t.sol`, and `GovTokenPrivacyTest.sol`.
- All tests pass, verifying deposit, registration, and governance flows.

---

## üîê ZK Proof Generation

The following TypeScript files demonstrate client-side proof generation for eERC20:

- `lib/encrypted-erc/src/runRegisterProof.ts` - Generates real ZK proofs for auditor registration
- `lib/encrypted-erc/src/registerProof.ts` - Proof generation logic using BabyJubJub and Poseidon
- `lib/encrypted-erc/src/runDepositProof.ts` -  Generates real ZK proofs for deposit

These scripts were used to generate the real proof for auditor `0x59c2C8Aa563d835F698543D6226c9c01ACf3a866` on Avalanche Fuji testnet.
